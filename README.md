## **Task1. Bigram Search in Wikipedia Corpus**

The script performs a search for bigrams (consecutive pairs of words) where the first word is _"narodnaya"_. It calculates the frequency of occurrences within the corpus of Wikipedia articles and outputs all discovered pairs along with their entry frequencies in lexicographical order.

## **Task2. BFS Algorithm Implementation**

The script implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path length between specified vertices in a directed graph. If multiple shortest paths exist, the script outputs the first encountered.
