task1: Bigram Search in Wikipedia Corpus

Objective:
The script performs a search for bigrams (consecutive pairs of words) where the first word is "narodnaya." It calculates the frequency of occurrences within the corpus of Wikipedia articles and outputs all discovered pairs along with their entry frequencies in lexicographical order.

Implementation:

Bigram Search:

Develop a script that scans the corpus of Wikipedia articles for instances where "narodnaya" is the first word in a bigram.
Count the occurrences of these bigrams to determine their frequency in the dataset.
Output Format:

Organize the output to display all identified pairs and their occurrence frequencies.
Arrange the output in lexicographical order for clarity.
task2: BFS Algorithm Implementation

Objective:
The script implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path length between specified vertices in a directed graph. If multiple shortest paths exist, the script outputs the first encountered.

Implementation:

BFS Algorithm:

Develop a script that applies the BFS algorithm to determine the shortest path between given vertices in a directed graph.
Output Format:

Configure the output to present the sequence of vertices, including the initial and final vertices, separated by commas without spaces.
Ensure clarity in presenting the shortest path information.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Run the task1 script to identify and analyze bigrams with "narodnaya" as the starting word.
Execute the task2 script to find the shortest path between specified vertices using BFS.
Review the output for both tasks, observing the identified bigram pairs and the shortest path information.
This GitHub project encompasses scripts for text analysis, specifically bigram search, and graph algorithms, focusing on the BFS algorithm for determining shortest paths in directed graphs.

Note: This description outlines a GitHub project dedicated to text analysis and graph algorithms, providing scripts for bigram search in a Wikipedia corpus and implementing the BFS algorithm for directed graphs.
